A simple iOS app designed to make spreading inspiration not only easy, but an enjoyable experience. Quotalicious was built with the goal of creating something ready to deploy in the time frame I was given. I also wanted to hone my skills in API calls, passing states and try my hand at a new technology (React Native). I obviously found a new calling in animations :green_heart: Mostly I wanted an app that I could experience the entire life cycle of development within a deadline and make people laugh :grimacing: I suppose now I would like to deploy!

### Observations

##### ðŸ§° Room for improvements

- Gestures! Definitely need to wrap my head around this a bit better. The swipe is cool, but then I couldn't figure out how to have both swipe AND tap before the deadline. I just want everything to be touchable in all kinds of ways :pensive:

- Animations!! Right, I know I've got a butt tonne of lottie animations, but animated transitions absolutely stumped me. I tried to implement those really awesome transitions that good old [Willy](https://www.youtube.com/user/wcandill) from FreeCodeCamp, but again, time was against me
- Testing testing testing 



##### :wrench: Next steps

- Deploy! :tada: 

- Authentication! Loved the idea of being able to see what your friends have saved and send them via the app! But then .... if you can share it through all the socials, maybe this isn't top of the list.

- A nice compromise might be to just have a profile page? 

- Click on the quote author for more info on them - especially for the inspirational ones as some are pretty interesting people!

- I really wanted to have more splash screens to show the app functionality, but then is that just an excuse to use more animations .... :smirk:

- It's a pretty fun app, so having a ban on lame quotes like 'live laugh love' :roll_eyes: would be pretty funny
